# Watermelon-book-puzzles

We are working on the puzzles in the Watermelon-book.

**Note that we are not sharing the answers but implementation of the algorithms. For example, `class KNeighborsClassifier` instead of 'runing knn on iris'**

Detailed puzzle and solution list can be found in the `Puzzles.md` in each folder. Here is a brief one:

|Algorithm|Description|Code|
|---|---|---|
|Dataset Space|Automatically generate the sample_space, hypothesis_space and version_space for a data set|[PY](./Chapter-01/DatasetSpace.py)|
|Union Hypothesis Space|Figure out how the number of hypothsis change with the disjunction become longer|[CPP](./Chapter-01/UnionHypothesisSpace.cpp) [PY](./Chapter-01/UnionHypothesisSpace.py)|
|Linear Regression|Binary Linear regression based on gradient descent (l-bfgs-b) without penalty|[PY](./Chapter-03/LinearRegression.py)
|Logistic Regression|Binary Logistic regression based on gradient descent (l-bfgs-b) without penalty|[PY](./Chapter-03/LogisticRegression.py)
|KNN| K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier |[PY](./Chapter-10/knn.py)

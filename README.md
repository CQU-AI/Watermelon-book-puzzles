# Watermelon-book-puzzles

We are working on the puzzles in the Watermelon-book. Puzzle and solution list can be found in the `Puzzles.md` in each folder.

**Note that we are not sharing the answers but implement of the algorithms. For example, `class KNeighborsClassifier` instead of 'runing knn on iris'**

## Everyone is welcomed to contribute!
